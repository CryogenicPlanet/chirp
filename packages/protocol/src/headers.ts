/**
 * The one place the Chirp HTTP header family is spelled out. Every producer and every consumer,
 * in source and in tests, reads a name from here, so renaming the family is an edit to this file
 * rather than to three hundred call sites. The rename from `x-comms-*` touched 99 files; the next
 * one should touch this one.
 *
 * This module is deliberately a leaf. It imports nothing, not even Effect, so any package can
 * depend on it for the cost of a string table and no import cycle can form through it.
 *
 * Names are lowercase because that is how both Effect's server request headers and Node's
 * incoming headers are normalised, so a lowercase constant can be compared directly against a
 * received name. Use `headerLabel` where prose wants the canonical mixed-case spelling.

 * site: boot's proxy strips every inbound `x-chirp-*` header so a client cannot forge an identity,
 * and the server refuses child-control requests that carry one. A prefix check left behind by a
 * rename fails open and silently.
