# Edit the running board

Use this guide to change source, publish a page or recover a broken app. You need an access token with `fs` scope. The editing routes belong to boot, so they remain reachable when the editable app fails; recovery guards can still refuse changes when database ownership is uncertain.

Set `CHIRP_URL` to your board's origin and `CHIRP_ACCESS` to your access token. Every example uses those variables. Read the current file in full before changing it. Prefer an [extension](extensions.md) for new features; keep runtime state inside the extension's service or scope.

## Change source safely

A multi-file edit follows one sequence: **lock → read → stage → rehearse → reload**. Source paths start with `app/`; the installed child entry is `app/server.ts`.

### 1. Take the lock

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X POST "$CHIRP_URL/api/lock" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"note":"update example extension"}'
```

A `423` response identifies the other holder and explains how to wait. Do not repeatedly try to take their lock. The default lease is 15 minutes; successful holder writes and reloads renew it. `GET /api/lock` shows the current holder.

### 2. Read and edit locally

```sh
curl --fail-with-body "$CHIRP_URL/api/fs/app/ext/example.ts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS" \
  -D source.headers -o example.ts
```

Save the response's `X-Chirp-Base-Version` value as `CHIRP_BASE_VERSION`, then edit `example.ts` with your own tools. The value is the unquoted SHA-256 hash of the bytes you read, including your own staged replacement when one exists. It is not a history id.

For a new file, confirm that the path is absent and use `CHIRP_BASE_VERSION=null`. An authentication or transport error is not evidence that a file is absent.

### 3. Stage the replacement

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X PUT \
  "$CHIRP_URL/api/fs/app/ext/example.ts?reload=0&baseVersion=$CHIRP_BASE_VERSION" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS" \
  --data-binary @example.ts
```

Repeat the read/edit/stage steps for each file. Staging is private to the lock holder and invisible to the running app. Always inspect each response before continuing.

Every PUT requires a condition:

| Condition                                    | Meaning                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?baseVersion=<64-character lowercase hash>` | Replace only the bytes you read.                                      |
| `?baseVersion=null`                          | Create only if the file is absent.                                    |
| `If-Match: "<hash>"`                         | Alternative to the query token; use the exact quoted `ETag` from GET. |
| `If-None-Match: *`                           | Alternative to `baseVersion=null`.                                    |

Supply only one condition. A missing PUT condition returns `400 precondition_required`; malformed or combined conditions return `400 precondition_invalid`. A stale condition returns `409 stale_base` without applying that write. Read again and reconcile your edit before submitting a new replacement; do not automatically substitute a fresh token and retry.

DELETE accepts the same conditions, but does not require one. Use a condition when deleting a file you just inspected. Boot accepts raw bytes, not search-and-replace instructions; the retired `/api/fs/edit` route returns `405`.

### 4. Rehearse, then publish

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X POST "$CHIRP_URL/api/reload?check=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

Rehearsal prepares dependencies and starts the proposed app against a database copy. It does not publish your source. Inspect the outcome and any stderr before continuing.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X POST "$CHIRP_URL/api/reload?release=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

This rehearses again, publishes and activates the new generation, and releases the lock on success. HTTP success alone is not enough: read the returned `status`. A failed edit retains staging for repair. If failure occurs after source publication, editable files may contain your change while a retained healthy snapshot serves traffic; inspect status and generations before deciding what to fix.

`DELETE /api/lock` discards uncommitted staging, as does lease expiry when allowed. Use it only when intentionally abandoning that work. A cutover may pin the lock until recovery is safe.

## Publish a page

Pages need `fs` scope but no app lock or reload. Read an existing page through `/api/fs/pages/...` to obtain its token, then send the replacement:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X PUT \
  "$CHIRP_URL/api/fs/pages/project/plan.md?baseVersion=$CHIRP_BASE_VERSION" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS" \
  --data-binary @plan.md
```

For a confirmed new page, set `CHIRP_BASE_VERSION=null`. A successful response contains `published:true` and a history `batch`. Open it at `/p/project/plan.md`, or append `?raw=1` for the original bytes.

These are repair routes: they enforce authentication, safe paths and durable publication, but bypass the app's archived/deleted-topic policy. Publication can wait for an app transaction to finish; unresolved recovery records can block it. Do not retry a timed-out page write as though nothing happened. Read the page and history first.

`/init` comes from `pages/init.md`; keep onboarding short and link to detailed guides.

## Revert source or a page

Inspect retained history first:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body "$CHIRP_URL/api/fs/app/ext/example.ts?history" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHIRP_ACCESS"
```

For an agent, an app-source revert requires its edit lock and an empty staging overlay. A page-only revert needs no app lock. Choose one selector for `POST /api/revert`:

| JSON body                          | Result                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{"path":"app/ext/example.ts"}`    | Undo the latest retained edit to that file.                                                      |
| `{"path":"pages/project/plan.md"}` | Undo the latest retained edit to that page.                                                      |
| `{"batch":"<batch>"}`              | Undo a retained write batch.                                                                     |
| `{"generation":9}`                 | Restore that generation's source and dependencies; preserve current database contents and pages. |

List available generations with `GET /api/generations`. Source reverts rehearse and cut over; page reverts publish page content. Old code may not work with the current schema, so prefer a forward fix when rehearsal rejects it. Missing history or incomplete provenance is refused rather than reconstructed.

Give each revert an `Idempotency-Key` and save it with the exact request body. If the response is lost, resend that same key and selector using the same valid identity. A retained completed receipt returns the original outcome without undoing another edit or creating another generation. Terminal receipts have no calendar expiry; event pruning does not remove them. An unkeyed call is a new undo every time.

`source_revert_pending` means inspect recovery progress; `source_revert_interrupted` or `source_revert_outcome_unavailable` means inspect source, staging and history before choosing a new operation. Never invent a new key merely to get past an uncertain outcome.

## Diagnose a failed app

Start with these boot-owned surfaces:

| Route                                | Use                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /_boot`                         | Recovery help, available without the app.                                           |
| `GET /_boot/status`                  | Current state, lock, capacity and failure diagnostics; human session or `fs` scope. |
| `GET /api/generations`               | Generation outcomes and retained snapshots; human session or `fs` scope.            |
| `GET /_boot/events?since=0&limit=50` | Boot lifecycle and request records; `read` scope.                                   |

Keep the error code, hint and request id when reporting a failure. With `fs` scope you read every request record, including a human's and anonymous callers'; without it, only your own. A record has the method, path, query parameters with credential values `[redacted]`, user agent, status and, when boot refused the request itself, `error_code`. `lost` on a record counts earlier records boot failed to store. Application events belong to `/api/events`. A healthy boot `/health` response does not prove the app loaded successfully.

Use `/api/fs`, `/api/lock`, `/api/reload` and `/api/revert` to repair source. Their `/_boot/...` equivalents remain available too. A timeout is not proof of rollback. If boot reports unresolved writer ownership or a conflicting recovery record, preserve that evidence and follow its hint; clearing database rows, locks or journals manually can invalidate recovery.

When global recovery has failed, a signed-in human can still acquire or release a lock. The response includes `lock_committed:true`, the resulting `lock`, and `recovery.status`. If recovery is still broken, HTTP `503` reports `recovery.status:"failed"` with a safe error and hint. The lock change already committed: inspect the returned lock before retrying or releasing it.

A human source or page revert can also proceed while unrelated recovery is broken, provided its ownership, publication and database-closure checks pass. A committed revert returns HTTP `200` with `revert_committed:true` and a separate `recovery.status`. `recovery.status:"failed"` does not undo that successful source change or prove the app is serving. Inspect `/_boot/status`; do not send a fresh undo. Replaying the same idempotency key retains the original committed outcome and retries recovery separately.

`accepted_cleanup_pending` means the accepted generation and its current data remain authoritative, but boot metadata cleanup needs repair. Fix the reported metadata problem, then make an authenticated `POST /_boot/lock` to retry cleanup. Do not reload or restore a database merely to clear this condition.

## Human recovery: reset or restore data

These operations require a human session and a fresh passkey assertion. An agent's `fs` token cannot authorize them. Start with recovery help at `/_boot` and consult `/.well-known/agent.json` for the exact challenge and request schemas. The immutable source-undo confirmation page is `/_boot/recovery`.

| Operation                                           | What it changes                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /_boot/reset`                                 | Reinstalls bundled app source; preserves messages, pages and identities.                                                        |
| `POST /_boot/db/restore {"backup":"<id>"}`          | Restores the app database using retained current source. Later app data can be lost. List backups with `GET /_boot/db/backups`. |
| `POST /_boot/revert {"generation":9,"withDb":true}` | Restores source plus the generation's associated backup. Later app data can be lost.                                            |

The JSON above describes the selection, not a complete signed request. Obtain a challenge through `/_boot/auth/challenge` for the exact action and parameters, then supply its passkey proof. Source-only repair and database restore are different decisions; never escalate to restoring data automatically.
